					<h1>About</h1>
					<p>Hello, it's Caleb.</p>
					<p>I'm an avid hobbyist, taking interest in photography, playing guitar, caring for house plants, cooking, drawing, programming, and video game making. This website serves to document some of the things I've made and am currently working on. Take a look if you're interested in what I've done...</p>

					<h1>Studies</h1>
					<p>Besides my hobbies, I'm currently investing my time into majoring in both Computer Science and Digital Narrative and Interactive Design (DNID) at the University of Pittsburgh. From my studies so far, I've not only learned the typical object-oriented-programming topics of Computer Science, like the practices of algorithms and data structures, but also the humanistic side of it too. DNID is a major that centers itself in the humanistic realm when it comes to the use of digital tools in creating narrative experiences. This is where I feel my heart is when it comes to my outlook on my college career. Learning about computer science is providing me with many great skills to create things with many tools. To me, DNID is like a throughline, showing me what can be done with these tools as well as the why and the how.</p>
