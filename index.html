					<h1>About</h1>
					<p>Hello, it's Caleb.</p>
					<p>I'm an avid hobbyist, taking interest in photography, playing guitar, caring for house plants, cooking, drawing, programming, and video game making. This website serves to document some of the things I've made and am currently working on. Take a look if you're interested in what I've done...</p>

					<h1>Studies</h1>
					<p>Besides my hobbies, I'm currently investing my time into majoring in both Computer Science and Digital Narrative and Interactive Design (DNID) at the University of Pittsburgh. From my studies so far, I've not only learned the typical object-oriented-programming topics of Computer Science, but also the humanistic side of it too. DNID is a major that centers itself in the humanistic realm when it comes to the use of digital tools in creating narrative experiences. This is where I feel my heart is when it comes to my outlook on my college career. Learning about computer science is providing me with many great skills to create things with many tools. To me, DNID is like a throughline, showing me what can be done with these tools as well as the why and the how.</p>

							<strong>The Goops</strong> is a 2d video game that Logan Cox and I created using the Unity Game Engine. We worked on this project for our DNID class, <a href="https://courses.sci.pitt.edu/courses/view/CMPINF-1201" target="_blank">CMPINF 1201</a>. The goal was to create a 2d video game in Unity, using a public domain childrens' book as inspiration. We chose Gelett Burgess' book titled <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/13004/13004-h/13004-h.htm" target="_blank"><i>MORE GOOPS and How Not to Be Them: A Manual of Manners for Impolite Infants</i></a>, which is where the name <strong>Goops</strong> comes from. The book is a sequence of poems about ill-mannered children, called “Goops” that do misdeeds, and the overall narrative is essentially making any children reading it self-conscious for their misdeeds, encouraging them to “reform” (Burgess 1903).
						</p>
						<p>
							Our game takes inspiration from this concept, with the player taking the role of a babysitter who must watch over a house full of Goops, whilst they all attempt to do dangerous misdeeds. The main gameplay comes from the clicking and dragging on the Goops to stop them and move them away from any misdeeds they are committing, each of which utilize various common, household objects. If a Goop does a misdeed for a certain amount of time without being interrupted by the player, the Goop perishes, as each misdeed is dangerous. After coming up with this idea, Logan and I began work on implementing it.
						</p>
						<p>
							Logan started right away on creating the art assets, including the Goop sprites and the many animations present in the final game. We did use an asset pack from Itchio for the <a href="https://muchopixels.itch.io/house-interiors-tileset-pack" target="_blank">house interior pixel art</a>. He also coded the main menu and the intro end ending dialogue cutscenes. I worked on programming the main game mechanics logic. This experience was exhilerating, as I was not too versed in Unity's AP, yet I had to keep going to complete the game before the deadline.
						</p>
						<p>
							I ended up learning a crazy ton of Unity and for the first time felt capable of creating any 2d game I could imagine. Fully immersing myself into Unity improved my fluency in it.
