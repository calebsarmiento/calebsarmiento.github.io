					<h1>About</h1>
					<p>Hello, this is Caleb. I'm now going to talk about myself in the third person.</p>
					<p>Caleb Sarmiento is an avid hobbyist, taking interest in photography, playing guitar, caring for house plants, cooking, drawing, programming, and video game developing. This website serves to document some of the things he's made and is working on. Take a look if you're interested in what he's done...</p>

					<br>

					<h1>Studies</h1>
					<p>Besides his hobbies, Caleb is currently investing his time into studying to major in both Computer Science and Digital Narrative and Interactive Design. He has learned of the typical object-oriented-programming topics of Computer Science, like the standard practices of algorithms and data structures, but also the humanistic side of it too. Digital Narrative and Interactive Design (DNID) is a major that centers itself in the humanistic realm of the use of digital tools in creating narrative experiences. This is where Caleb feels his heart is when it comes to his approach of his college career.</p>
					<p>Caleb feels that learning about Computer Science provides him with great skills to create with many tools, and DNID takes the role of providing a throughline, showing what can be done with those tools as well as why and how they should be done. He wouldn't like for anyone studying Computer Science to neglect humanistic principles when designing and creating anything.</p>
